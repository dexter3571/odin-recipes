    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Some recipes are worth the extra time and effort, and this Shrimp and Sausage Gumbo is one of them. It’s the perfect cozy and comforting dish with heavenly, deeply flavored bites. 
        Gumbo is one of Louisiana’s oldest and most treasured dishes. This chicken sausage shrimp gumbo is my take on the classic. </p>
        <p>The roux is the key to making shrimp sausage gumbo. It’s the base of all authentic gumbo recipes as it offers the distinct thick, luscious stock. This recipe begins with a dark brown roux before moving on to the irresistible layers of shrimp, sausage, and Cajun flavors. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Bell Peppers</li>
            <li>Celery</li>
            <li><em>Andouille Sausage</em></li>
            <li>Cajun Spice Blend</li>
            <li>Broth (Chicken, Vegetable, or Fish)</li>
            <li>Coconut aminos</li>
            <li>Shrimp (Large and Raw)</li>
            <li>Frozen Okra</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, whisk the oil and flour together for 20 minutes or until the roux is a deep caramel color. Yes, it’s a little time-intensive, but if you want a proper roux, this is what needs to be done!</li>
            <li>Now that the roux is ready, add the onion, bell pepper, and celery to the pot. Saute until the veggies soften. Add the garlic cloves and cook until fragrant. </li>
            <li>Next, add the sausage, Cajun seasoning, salt, and cayenne. Pour the chicken stock, water, diced tomatoes, coconut aminos, and bay leaves into the pot and stir. Bring it up to a low boil and let it simmer for just under 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Add the peeled and thawed shrimp and okra once the time is up. Continue simmering until the shrimp is pink and opaque. </li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaves from the pot. Ladle some sausage gumbo into serving bowls over rice, garnish with green onions, then enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
